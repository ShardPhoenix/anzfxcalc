FX Calculator by Ryan Sattler

For this exercise I have focused on accuracy and a clean design rather than performance.
Greater performance could potentially be achieved through means such as use of arrays of primitives rather than classes,
or by pre-computation of certain values.

Requires Gradle and Java 11.

Build:
`./gradlew build`

Test:
'./gradlew test'

Run (after build):
`java -jar build/libs/anztest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
